# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning models like Random Forest and XGBoost. It includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

## 🚀 Features
- Extracted and cleaned customer data (ETL process).
- Performed feature engineering on customer behavior patterns.
- Built and optimized ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost).
- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
- (Optional) Deployed using Flask and an interactive dashboard.

## 📊 Results
- Model achieved **XX% accuracy** with **AUC-ROC score of XX**.
- Feature importance analysis showed that **Tenure, Monthly Charges, etc.** were key churn indicators.
- See the full report in `notebooks/`.

## 📢 Future Improvements
- Try deep learning models like LSTMs.
- Deploy the model using a web framework.
- Add more customer behavior features.
